Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to enhance marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.
The dataset used in this project is the "ecommerce customer data".It contains customer information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalization.
The project employs K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups. Feature selection was based on customer demographics and purchasing behavior. The Elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
The clustering analysis revealed four distinct customer segments characterized by different purchasing behaviors. Insights derived from these segments can inform targeted marketing strategies.
